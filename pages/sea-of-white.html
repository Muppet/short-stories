    <p>Today was going to be a rough day. The fog came rolling in from the harbour front, like a heavy carpet it flowed and washed over the cobblestones, giving the impression that the city grew out of a grey sea of velvet. Moisture hung in the air, the subtle promise of rain left unspoken, but given. Not that it mattered. The whaling ships were coming back today, and it was going to take more than a little rain to keep people from the market stalls on whaling day.

        A deafening crack echoed throughout the valley, where Port Freefall was nestled between the pale peaks, the sound of rolling thunder, not far behind.
        
        Ok, a lot of rain. Jim bitterly thought to himself as he realised he'd left his coat at the workshop. He could feel the low ache in his elbow that tended to be a precursor to bad weather, but he couldn't turn back now. The Old Man would skin him if he came back without the oil, and he could already see the other shop lads pouring out of the stores on Tinker Street, making their way across the slippery cobblestones, kicking up fog as they went. In front of him, Harry, the Tanner's hand, called out as he slid on the wet stones and landed heavily on his back. He all but submerged in the fog as he went down and Jim heard a wet, hard thud as he connected with the stones. He hoped it hurt as he ran past. Harry was a right bastard as far as he was concerned. Him and his thug mates had roughed Jim up pretty bad last whaling day, and tried to take one of his oil barrels. They'd have managed too, if Sara hadn't shown up and smacked him about the head with an oar. They hadn't quite known what to do about that, as getting in a fight with her at the market would draw attention. So they'd left, but Jim knew he'd be paying for that humiliation sooner or later.
        
        Maybe sooner, he thought to himself, as he ran past the burnt down Alchemist's Guild Hall. Sara would be helping the other hands rebuild, still. They'd have no need of oil until they were up and running again, so he couldn't count on her being present today, should Harry manage to corner him. Jim had a feeling he'd try, if his fall just before caused him to arrive late at the market. No one wanted to come back without oil, and it wasn't like he hasn't attempted in the past.
        
        There was a sense of urgency in the air that Jim felt all too deeply. If this haul was like the last one, there wouldn't be enough crude oil for everyone, and reserves had been running low across the city. Silja's Artificer Repair had run out first, which had led to chaos when the Arc Brotherhood's lightning conductors had overheated and discharged, cracking the crystal in the process. Without a steady flow of tools and repairs, the machines holding the crystals kept melting and it took them a full week to harness enough lightning to get the conductors up and running again last time, which in turn left much of the city blacked out in the meantime.
        
        He had heard The Old Man talk to Silja one night, about how the Arc Brotherhood had been needing more repairs than usual lately. Arc Tech was unstable at the best of times, as you could imagine harnessing lightning would be, but Silja was convinced they'd been trying to ration their oil supplies too rigidly, which had led to more discharges than normal. Jim instinctively ran his fingers across the scar on this left forearm. He hardly noticed these days, except when it acted up in times of rain. He had helped construct several Arc Crystals and knew how volatile they could be. Heating up the quartz glass was one thing, but the process of forming the hollow crystals, and trapping the aether gas inside, before sealing it, always made his skin crawl.
        
        The whole process had to be done while the quartz was still hot enough to shape, and since aether gas was at least part whale oil fumes, it was highly flammable. And this was before those crazy bastards from the Brotherhood attempted to store lightning inside it. He didn't know exactly what went into making the gas, no one outside the Brotherhood did, but if the mixture was too dense, it would choke the lightning, and it couldn't penetrate it. Too light, and it would act as a super conductor and discharge. Explode, in other words. You had to get it just right, in order to shoot lightning at a crystal, and have it lose just enough energy that it couldn't penetrate out the other side again.
        
        He wondered for a moment if that's what had happened with the Alchemists Guild Hall? Had someone dropped a crystal, shattering it? If the gas got diluted by air, it was basically a bomb, when near fire… And if there was one thing the Alchemists had a lot of, it was fire.
        
        He lost track of his thoughts as he rounded the corner of the street, and the markets opened up before him. The square was flanked by the tall buildings and offices of the administrative workers, merchants and some of the more extravagant nobility of Port Freefall, and stretched on for almost a mile, before merging with the harbour docks. People were milling about their business, as market day attracted all manner of folk. The chorus of voices, laughter, children crying and merchants haggling filled the air, amid the colourful banners and flags, dragged between the stalls and across the market square. A cacophony of noise and chaos greeted Jim, and for a moment he forgot his urgency, as he strained his eyes, trying to see the mountain peaks he knew flanked the city on each side, leading into the bay. He'd always thought it stands how, Inside the city, the fog tended to pool between ankle and shin height, but beyond the docks, it was a solid wall of grey. He'd been told it has something to do with altitude, and that it was wind, keeping it up beyond the pier, but he'd never quite understood it.
        
        Today was particularly bad though, so the peaks were nowhere to be seen. He wondered briefly, what it must be like, navigating the ships into harbor in this weather, slowly drifting forward, scouting the fog for signs of the beacons that told them how close they were. Once or twice inexperienced captains had come in a little too fast, and hit the docks, but most were worried about falling overboard enough to err on the side of caution.
        
        He walked through the crowd, toward the docks and was annoyed to find that while it was early still, the place was already packed. Everywhere, people were milling around the traders, buying and selling. He was worried that the oiling stations would already have put up signs saying that sales were pending supply. He had hoped to get in his order early, so he could be sure of delivery, but this was worse than he'd imagined. Maybe he shouldn't have been surprised though. They'd been gone for a long time, this time. Usually, whaling didn't take this long, but the hunts had been scarce lately. The ships had to venture further and further out, and they'd lost a full crew just last month, when a behemoth whale had attacked a vessel. The impact would be bad enough, but igniting the gas that far out. There was no coming back from that.
        
        He'd heard talks of something in the mists, that was making the whales more aggressive. Normally they wouldn't attack a ship, but there had been three incidents just last hunt, and the need for repairs had almost meant that The Gambit hadn't been able to set sail with the others. That would have marked the first time in over thirty years, where she would have missed a voyage, and even then the last time was due to her Captain dying just before departure, not some shortcoming of The Gambit herself.
        
        Jim had always loved that ship, ever since he was a kid, and had spent many a waking moment daydreaming about joining her crew. As he got to the piers, he lost a few moments even now, staring into the mist, picturing her hull suddenly emerging through the mist. Drifting silently and majestically on the ocean of white, that obfuscated the valley below. On a rare day, when the sun really came through and the dog lifted, you could see through the shimmering haze of the clouds, all the way down. The braver youths would gather by the dock railings and lean over, to get a good view of the cliff face, falling away beneath them. On clear days, people would sometimes throw little trinkets over the edges, and watch them sink through the shimmer, before falling to the deep, below.
        
        While the aether gas balloons and sacks would keep the skyships afloat above the clouds, they seemed to have no effect when they passed beneath. If something crossed through the shimmer, it wasn't coming back up again.
        
        He'd heard tales of cities far away, with great spires that pierced through the shimmer, from down below, where people could travel up and down the spine of these towers, to the land beneath, but he found that hard to believe. They were tales for children, surely. Nevertheless, he couldn't help but imagine what it must be like, seeing these impossible structures rise out of the sea of white.
        
        "Well, well, well… Fancy finding you here without your little friend, Hopper"
        
        Jim's heart sank, as he recognised Harry's voice, behind him. And as if by command, felt the first drops of rain hit him as he slowly turned to face him. By his side were the usual goons, slowly fanning out around him.
        
        "Ah" Jim managed, trying to remember to breathe, while frantically looking for a way through Harry's lads. "Hi, Harry. Glad to see that fall didn't stop you showing up today" Jim's mouth said, while his brain tried to find out when "suicide" had been added to the usual options of "Fight or Flight".
        
        "Think you're funny eh", Harry said, cracking his knuckles. "Well see how funny you are, once we've had a little chat". Around them, thunder rolled across the city, and Jim swallowed hard.
        
        Today was going to be a rough day.
