    <p>Trust not the baleful light, for it brings naught but ruin. While it may comfort us with shallow promises of meaning and direction, its lies run deeper, down into the fathomless depths of deceit.

        House of Light
        
        The light has gone out, we’re sailing blind, is the only thought in her head, as she climbs down the rope ladder from the main mast lookout. The impact of the waves crashing against the ship reverberates up the rope into her fingers, as the people beneath her are thrown off their feet. What had merely been some clouds moments prior, has now turned into a full force storm, blotting out the stars and the islands ahead. It came out of nowhere, the sudden impact throwing them off course and veering dangerously close to the rocks surrounding the bay. The roaring wind is almost impenetrable, with the muffled yells and screams of her crewmates barely audible over the roaring storm tears into the sails with booming force, threatening to tear them to shreds. The rain stings as it whips at her face and threatens to blind her, should she look any other direction than down. Lightning traces green lines through the clouds and Bathori holds onto the rope ladder, her knuckles turning white, as another wave crashes into the ship, sending her legs kicking and flailing from side to side, as she desperately clings on. Her eyes forced closed, the salt stained tears mixing with the spatter the ocean throws at her, as the rain cuts her cheeks and fingers. Unable to wipe her hair from her face, or the tears from her eyes, she frantically kicks about, until her feet find footing once more. Shaking, she feels the cold air fill her lungs in ragged breaths, as she opens her eyes to take in the chaos. Her gaze cast down, as to look in any other direction, is to invite the stinging rain.
        
        Below her, people are yelling as they struggle to cut the sails, lest the mast snaps under the strain, and a sudden tug of waves sends something (or someone) over the port side, into the furious deep. She squints through teary eyes and matted hair, trying to make out what, but in the chaos, the frantic silhouettes created by the lanterns' greenish glow are all she truly sees.
        
        “Green”, Bhatori thinks to herself. “Were they always green?”. Before she can give it any thought, a loud crack above her sends the main top yard crashing down, the wood torn asunder by the strain. The sail rips as the weight of the beam pulls it down, and it plummets into the frantic screams below.  With the wind no longer blocked by the sail, the rope ladder starts swinging wildly, and for a moment, she fears she’ll be thrown from the ship but another crash of the waves tilts the mast to the side, granting her brief respite from the wind.
        
        Bhatori scampers down the ladder as fast as she can, her feet slipping on occasion but her hands always holding on tight. As she reaches the bottom she holds on tight to the mast, planting both feet firmly on the deck. All around her, people are trying to shift through the wreckage of the fallen top yard, and blood has coated the deck where some were unable to clear the crash site fast enough. The sail is holding part of the yard in suspension, its hefty beam swinging dangerously from side to side, as people try to clear out their trapped crewmates beneath it. Bhatori turns to a young man, running toward her yelling something in the wind, but before she can make out what it is, the yard swings towards them. She raises a hand and opens her mouth to yell a warning, but too late the yard connects with the main mast, the young man caught between them.
        
        She stands motionless, goblets of red sprayed in her eyes, forcing her to look down, shock holding her body in a frozen grip. The young man’s body slumps to the ground before her, its head missing and the upper torso in ruin. Violently, Bhatori expels her stomach onto the deck, its greenish hue mixing with the saltwater and blood and stands heaving as the world around her swirls.
        
        Moments pass before she steadies herself, her eyes seeking the helm but the rain and blood constantly forcing her to avert her eyes and look down. She ponders her chances of making it there and swallows hard, looking for courage she doesn’t possess. The massive wooden beam swings again, and need forces her from inaction. Steeling herself, she takes a step forward and loses her footing almost instantly as she steps in the sick she expelled mere moments earlier. Before her flailing hands can find support a flash of pain strikes her forehead and darkness engulfs her eyes, as the deck rushes to meet her.
        
        
        The light entices, as it dances through the dark as a lure for the soul, but all bait belies its true purpose. There is no solace nor absolution in its touch, only ruin, for just as we see the world through the light, that which wields it sees us in turn. To follow the light down, is to invite doom.
        
        
        Bhatori opens her eyes and lets out a groan. The only sound she can hear is her own breath, and the gentle creaking of wood under her as she stirs. The screams and yells are gone, but more surprisingly, so is the storm, and the sound of the sea. All is quiet around her, the ship lies motionless upon a black mirror of water, its dark reflection alive with chaos, but her side of the reflection is quiet as a tomb. Not a ripple or wave breaks the water’s surface, but not a thousand yards from the ship, the clouds and storm still visibly rages in a perfect sphere around the vessel.
        
        The eye of the storm is both a welcome respite, yet alarmingly other, as the total silence surrounds her. The unnatural calm, surrounded by the rage of the storm on the horizon makes her hairs stand on end, and her breath seem harsh against the silence. Green streaks of lightning cascade the walls of the cylinder, leading all the way to a perfect dark sky and the stars that inhabit it, who’s baleful light casts an eerie glow on this now silent world. They blink in and out of existence, and she cannot help but feel they are watching her from afar. 
        
        Motion in the water catches her attention, and she leans over and sees a raging storm, and a vessel headed for doom, in the reflection. Though they are joined at the waterline, her own ship sits as if on solid ground, contrasting the erratic image cast back at her. The people in the reflection run frantically beneath her and as she observes, she can’t help but hold on tight to the railing, as her perspective flips to see her looking up at them, from below. She observes as waves crash into the sides of the boat, but through them, strange twinkles of light dance across the water’s surface. They cloud her vision, willing her to look upon them, but cause her eyes to dry up as she tries. She cannot look up at the storm in the reflection, her eyes burning from the effort, but with a moment of sudden clarity, she turns her eyes to the stars in her own horizon, still clutching the railing as if she were afraid she would fall into the sky itself.
        
        These stars seem different, somehow. It is no night sky she can remember, and the way they blink in and out of existence makes her feel observed. But despite this discomfort, she finds herself unable to look away. The baleful light makes the sky itself seem fathomless and vast. As though no light can truly escape from its crushing depth, an abyss of perfect darkness, the lost lights flickering about its divide, forever trapped. Whenever she tries to turn her gaze from the lights, her eyes swell and sting shut. She forces herself to look back at the reflection in the water, but a mounting sense of vertigo threatens to overwhelm her. The more she tries to look at the sky she once knew in the mirror, the more it feels like her weight is shifting, that she’s hanging from the railing, rather than leaning on it. She turns her face toward her new sky once more, and her eyes open to find her hanging from the ship upside down. The boat suspended in perfect darkness, its mirror reflection in the still water, the only sign that it was ever connected to anything, in this empty void. As she observes the lights blinking below her, she finally accepts what she has always known. She takes one more breath, before she lets go and plummets towards the depths of the sky.
        
        We flock to the light, as though its presence promises us respite from the storm, but we are fools to chase that which flickers for the substance lies not with the intangible, but that which lies beneath. And substance will not be sated by hopes and promises alone.
        
        With a start and a lurch in her stomach, she wakes as she feels herself fall from her chair. Her head hits the floor with a thud, and she lies there, blinking for a moment, contemplating her dream. Impressions of a storm dance across her eyes, in tune to the greenish light from her candle. She looks around the lighthouse for a moment, before getting to her feet and as she does, a crack of lightning flashes past outside. Turning to the window, she sees a storm on the horizon, and silhouetted against the lightning, the masts of a seafaring vessel. She waits for the shaft of light to make its rotation, showing them the way, but after a moment has passed, her heart sinks as no light appears.
        
        The light has gone out, they’re sailing blind, she thinks to herself, as she makes for the spiral staircase that runs the length of the tower. Looking up she makes for the spire her steps growing heavier and more burdensome with every passing moment. By the time she reaches the upper windows, panting and short of breath, a flickering light catches her eye, and she stops and looks down and her fatigue ebbes from her limbs. The candle on her desk is casting green hued shadows on the room below, and she stops for a moment to observe the fickle light. She instinctively grabs the stairway railing, as a sense of vertigo sets in, emphasising how far down the light is. She has to fight her knees to not give in, and remain standing. Behind her, something stirs outside but as she turns around, she sees nothing but blackness. The storm is gone, as is the ship and the landscape. All she sees is fathomless black. With lights, flickering far, far below. She turns her eyes back to the desk in front of her. The green light from the candle flickering and filling the room with shadows. The stairs in front of her spiral down, to the light room below.
        
        Her mind reels for a moment, convinced it had just climbed the stairs, but looking around her, she sees she’s still in the main room, by the table where she hit her head. No time for delays, she thinks to herself. I need to turn on the light. She descends the spiral staircase, candle in hand, down and down it goes, as the green light casts shadows on the walls. Passing the window before the light spire, she looks into the darkness before her, sombrely nodding as her duty is clear. Somewhere out there, something slowly stirs, but she only sees the ship in the storm.
        
        She enters the spire, hanging from the end of the stairwell, and carefully moves toward the central platform where the beacon hangs. Beneath the glass dome, the world drops away into fathomless nothingness, the light from her candle unable to pierce the darkness. Carefully she lifts the rotating plates and uses her candle to light the beacon. Green light emanates in all directions, and for a brief moment, she fancies she sees a cliff wall right in front of the canopy outside. She lowers the plated list before checking, and a solid beam of green light punctures the darkness around her. As it makes its full rotation, she sees the image of the ship in her mind, a fierce storm raging about it. Before her, the cliff wall parts to reveal an eye the size of the spire. Its focus slowly and inevitably centres on the baleful light as it caresses its surface. The fathomless sleeper stirs, and with it. The storm.
        
        As we bathe in the baleful light, we make ourselves seen to those who are dead, but eternally lie dreaming. In their fever dreams they prey upon those who seek the light, luring them ever deeper, ever down.
