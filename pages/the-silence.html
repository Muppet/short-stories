    <h1>The Silence and the Lamb.</h1>

    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">I… I think there's been some kind of mistake"</span> Mark said finally. He'd been standing in front of the podium waiting for some kind of explanation to all of this, but the… The Clerk, for lack of a better word, had simply crossed off his name in the great big book, as though that had been answer enough. He shuffled his feet nervously as he waited for the Clerk to notice him.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Mhh?"</span> it said eventually in a voice that was more felt than heard. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Was there anything else?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Well… I mean. This is all wrong"</span> Mark protested again. <span class="speech silence-mark">"I'm in the wrong place. I have to be. You've made some kind of mistake!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"That seems unlikely"</span> it said in a bemused voice. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"You are Mark Appleby, yes?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Well… Yes"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Of 147 Orchid Drive?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"... Yes"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Well there you are then. Welcome to Heaven! Now, if you'll be as kind as to carry on through the pearly gates, worship starts once you've found your quarters in the Hallowed Halls"</span> the Clerk gestured to a giant gate made of smooth, pure blackness. It's surface seemed polished almost to a shine, yet it was a pale and bitter shine, the blackness devouring all hints of light. It looked all wrong. Beside, the Pearly Gates were supposed to be white as far as Mark was concerned. Maybe a cloudy pink grey, but definitely not polished black...</p>
    
    <p>He stood there for a moment, staring at the brimstone podium looming before him. He found it hard to determine exactly what the Clerk was, because it kept changing shape, but the impression that was left on his mind were words like "big" and "red" and most upsettingly, "on fire". Mark was particularly struggling with this last notion as he knew beyond a doubt that angels weren't supposed to be on fire. Talking bushes in the desert, possibly. But not the angels themselves.</p>
    
    <p>And then there were the horns. They were protruding from what he assumed was its head, though the shape itself kept changing depending on the angle he observed it from. Just as worryingly, Mark was sure the red vine wrapped lazily around the base of the podium, flicking from side to side, was in fact its tail.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"This can't be heaven. It can't be… Besides, you're a demon!"</span> He eventually managed, regretting it almost instantly. Mark froze, as he realised his words seemed to have upset the Clerk, or at the very least gotten its attention. He wasn't quite sure if this wasn't somehow worse. It was regarding him with more eyes than had any right to exist in any one head.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"I beg your pardon?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"A demon! You must be! You're on fire for Christ's sake!"</span> Another hesitation at his last remark. It wasn't like him to take the Lord's name in vain, but he really was very upset, so before his brain could stop it, his mouth continued.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"And that!"</span> He gestured to a burning river that ran behind the Clerk, flowing to a great tree that appeared to be equally on fire, with 12 kinds of pulsating, black, bulbous fruits. <span class="speech silence-mark">"What do you call that?! Heaven has the tree of life, not… Whatever that is!"</span></p>
    
    <p>The Clerk sighed deeply, like a parent who'd just realised they were going to have to explain how food can enter one place, but something else comes out another. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Ah... One of the inquisitive ones, I see"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Excuse me?"</span> mark said, almost affronted, but the if the Clerk noticed, it gave no sign.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Very well then, let's start out slow. Is it not written, in the book of revelations 22:1-5, that 'the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal'?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Yes! Exactly!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Well, can it not be said that while fire is a source of destruction, it is also a force of creation?... And is it not undeniably bright?"</span></p>
    
    <p>Mark's eyes widened with disbelief. <span class="speech silence-mark">"What? But… It's supposed to be clear water. Fire can't flow!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Says who?" </span>the Clerk asked bemused and cast a glance at the river that, as much as Mark wasn't happy about it, definitely was flowing. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Besides, it goes on to say 'and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits' and as you can see, it is clearly all right there"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"But… But those fruits are disgusting! They're moving. And oily black. That can't be the fruit of life!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"I don't see why not. Have you ever had Durian Fruit? Or Horned Melon or Bael Fruit? Nasty little things. Hardly what you'd call appetising"</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Well… What about you then?! Explain that!"</span> Mark said, pointing an accusing finger at the Clerk. <span class="speech silence-mark">"You're on fire! Angels aren't supposed to be on fire!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Is that so? And what on earth gave you that idea?</span>" The Clerk replied, sounding almost a little offended. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"I believe your word for us is 'Seraphim', yes?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"... Yes?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Well that merely means 'to burn' in old Hebrew, which is where you all got the first translations from. I'd have thought the hint was in the name?"</span>. The manner in which it delivered this line was as though it thought this explanation enough, and as to indicate that he was dismissed, the Clerk cast its gaze back toward the big book.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"This is all wrong,"</span> Mark whimpered, his tenuous grasp on sanity slowly slipping. It was bad enough that he had died before his day off, now he was having to deal with what could only be described as "otherworldly bureaucracy". Surely this was what hell was like.</p>
    
    <p>He was increasingly aware of the wails, moans and chants coming from all around him, rising above the burning city that lay behind the Clerk. <span class="speech silence-clerk">'Bright City'</span>, a terrible voice in his head corrected.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"No these are the screams and wails of the damned!"</span> Mark protested. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"I shouldn't think so"</span>, the voice replied and for a moment Mark wondered who had said that. The Clerk wasn't paying him any attention but there was no one else here. No matter, nothing sacred could ever make such wails, of that, he was certain.</p>
    
    <p>Just as his mind reached this conclusion, the Clerk let out a deep sigh and pinched what Mark assumed was the bridge of a nose, with what he hoped was a hand, before turning its full attention to him. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"What you are hearing, is the eternal prayer. As with all prayers, you get used to it with time"</span> The Clerk replied matter of factly <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Like I said, once you find your quarters you surrender your will to God and take your place in the great pra-</span>"</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"I'm sorry, I what?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Take your place in the grea-"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"No before that… I surrender my will?! I never agreed to that!"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"I'm fairly sure you did"</span> said the Clerk and managed to convey a frown in its voice that would have been impossible to detect on its ever changing face. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"It was clearly stated in the material you were given"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"What!? What material?"</span> Mark was becoming increasingly distressed about this whole ordeal. Someone was going to have to answer for this, of that he was sure.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"The book you all carry around all the time. It's all in there, look it really can't be my fault if you're not even going to bother reading the manual you were provided"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Book? What book? What in God's name are you talking about?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"The Bible of course...And please don't take His name in vain, it's considered rather impolite"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"..."</span> Mark's mouth stood ajar. <span class="speech silence-mark">"Now I know you're a demon!"</span> he exclaimed triumphantly <span class="speech silence-mark">"Where in the Bible does it say I am to surrender my free will?!"</span></p>
    
    <p>The Clerk sighed, before it flicked through the pages in its great big tome, with a flick of a would-be wrist, and Mark thought he could see the letters rearrange themselves on the pages that turned before him. Then it read:</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"'And all nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the Lord. No more shall they follow the dictates of their evil hearts' Jeremiah 3:17. It clearly says right here, that the whims of the heart, and its desires, are evil, and upon coming here to the throne of the Lord, you will no longer be a slave to such trivial impulses. And since desire is to want, we found that simply removing wanting, was the easiest solution. It's all rather elegant really, if you think about it."</span></p>
    
    <p>Mark looked upon the Clerk with disbelief. He couldn't believe what he was hearing, but if the Clerk noticed or cared, it gave no indication. Instead it continued.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"'Therefore they are before the throne of God, and shall serve him day and night in His temple. They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor heat. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes'".</span> The Clerk paused at the last passage and mused. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Well, I guess it should be rectified that we found it much more convenient to simply remove the eyes, instead of wiping away tears all the time, but apart from that it clearly states that the eternal prayer is, well, eternal, with neither sleep nor day or night getting in the way"</span>. It turned the book around for Mark to see and read <span class="speech silence-clerk">"'Day and night' it's right there, see"</span> as it jabbed a clawed finger at the passage in the great book.</p>
    
    <p>Mark interrupted before it could carry on, having just realised another thing that was bothering him about all of this. <span class="speech silence-mark">"I was actually wondering about that… Where is the sun?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Ah..."</span> the Clerk said, taken aback slightly. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"I believe Revelation 21:23-25 has you covered there. Let's see 'The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light'"</span> it read. <span class="speech silence-clerk">" And look, you've got incredible timing actually. You can see the Lamb just over there, tending to his flock".</span> It gestured toward a lone figure, half man, half goat, brown curly hair down to his shoulders. He was dressed in a white robe, walking amongst the rows of eternal worshippers, as a shepherd would his flock. Mark noticed his hands had gaping holes in them.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"On that topic, I actually think one of your songs captured the essence of it all, very well"</span> it tried, in a more jovial tone. Mark was trying hard to concentrate on it's ever changing shape. He could have sworn that for a moement, it was little more than a wheel, with too many eyes and wings, and he wasn't sure 'jovial' was something his mind could comfortably connect with the shapes in front oh him.</p>
    
    <p>Unperturbed, it carried on <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Yes, 'Amazing Grace' I believe it was called. 'When we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun'"</span></p>
    
    <p>Mark swallowed dryly… <span class="speech silence-mark">"But... That's was a metaphor" he tried, although he didn't know how much he believed it anymore.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Was it?"</span> The Clerk gazed at him quizzically. Or as quizzically as an ever shifting number of eyes could.</p>
    
    <p>Looking back toward the Lamb, Mark had the sinking realisation that this was indeed his "saviour". Although the goat legs made him think of someone else. Was this really why he was referred to as the Lamb? He also noticed that the source of light in this place came not from the sky, but from the fiery beings, the burning lake, and a great light at the centre of the black marble city. There, he beheld what he realised must surely be the burning light of God. It singed his eyes to stare at it, but he found himself unable to blink or look away. All too late he realised that while he could still see the light, his eyes had been burned from his sockets under its intensity, yet curiously, he felt no discomfort. It almost felt as though an invisible hand had wiped the fluids from his cheeks, as his eyes had melted. Under his breath, he finished the passage from Revelation 21:4 <span class="speech silence-mark">"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."</span></p>
    
    <p>The Clerk seemed to perk up as he thought this. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"See, now you get it. It just goes on and on and on like this, forever. Just like you all tell yourselves it will, while you're alive. If you worship in life, you come here, and worship in his light in the afterlife. Exactly as you wanted!"</span> Mark noticed that short of the wails and chants of worship, there were no other sounds in the city, apart from the conversation he was having now. The silence felt almost deafening. Normal silence was merely the absence of sound but this felt like its opposite. An all consuming nothingness that demanded his attention in the same way that a roaring explosion would. The only thing convincing him that sound itself still existed were the wails and autonomous chants of worship, which in turn replaced the normal, and became a form of silence in itself.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"No more distractions, no more fear or selfish thoughts getting in the way. Just love from the light, and complete peace of being without any of the turmoil that stems from emotion or thought. Everything you were promised and always wanted!"</span></p>
    
    <p>Mark couldn't be sure, but he thought it was smiling. That just made it all the more terrible to behold. Then it occurred to him again that despite knowing his eyes were gone, the being in front of him was imprinted in his mind, clear as ever. He paused as he turned his head, and saw the otherworldly light of the… Angels, he supposed, and the burning rivers and trees, pierce the darkness of his blindness. The silhouette of the black pearl city was somehow a darker shade of black in his mind, looming in the background. All around, he could make out the shape of the city and its fiery inhabitants, but the worshippers were but shadows now, flickering wisps of darkness amongst the golden flames.</p>
    
    <p>His heart sank, as he realised the awful truth of his situation: He truly was dead, and whatever afterlife he'd been promised in life, they'd gotten a few crucial details very wrong. <span class="speech silence-mark">"Can I…"</span> he began.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Yes?"</span> The Clerk replied, not unkindly.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Can I ask what happens to the others?"</span> Mark finally managed. <span class="speech silence-mark">"To the sinners?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Sinners?... Oh, you mean the people who didn't follow your rules, but instead lived lives of questions, and were ruled by whims of the heart and selfish desires?"</span></p>
    
    <p>Mark swallowed when he heard it phrased like that. <span class="speech silence-mark">"Yes? You said everyone comes here?"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Well no, obviously not. It would be cruel to send people places they didn't want to go, so only His flock comes here. Most don't go anywhere at all, but everyone goes where they mean to. An life of obedience and worship, leads to an afterlife of obedience and worship. Desire leads to desire, nothing leads to nothing. It was designed this way to allow your life to lead to the afterlife you wanted"</span>. The Clerk tilted its head and attempted a look that Mark suspected was supposed to be sympathy, but with a dozen constantly shifting in and our of it's face. Suddenly felt a bit squeamish. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"It's all very metaphysical"</span> it carried on. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Since belief fuel everything, each afterlife is made to harness the convictions of those who enter, ensuring a constant supply of worship in each their own ways. It's ultimately what keeps the lights on aroun dhere"</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-mark">"Lights? You mean it keeps the universe running?"</span> Mark said, with uncertain hope. Some semblance of a promise that it was at least not all for naught, if it fueled all of creation itself.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Hmh? Oh Heavens no. No just the lights. It takes a lot to fuel a burning lake you see, and don't get me started on the light at the centre. We found that belief burns brighter than any other substance so we built everything here to harness it. No the universe sort of just gets on with its own thing. It doesn't really care what you get up to"</span></p>
    
    <p>If the Clerk noticed Mark wince at the notion that nothing he'd ever done mattered, it made no show of it. <span class="speech silence-clerk">"Anyway, as much as I'd love to sit and chat, there's a bit of a queue building behind you and I really must get back to work. Someone apparently ate a winged mammal at a market and it seems "thoughts and prayers" did their usual job of stemming the flow. I suspect we're about to be quite busy for a while. Work never ends, eh?"</span> The Clerk remarked jovially, as it returned to its great book.</p>
    
    <p><span class="speech silence-clerk">"Next please! Ah, welcome mortal, if you'd please state your name?"</span> It said to someone behind him, and Mark felt a strange compulsion to advance through the black gates. He heard a voice exclaim <span class="speech silence-mark">"But this can't be right! I'm in the wrong place!"</span> as he walked, but didn't bother turning around to see who else was about to realise that dying wasn't the worst thing to happen to them today.</p>
    
    <p>Mark stepped forward, feeling his ability to resist fading with each step. Before him, the Lamb turned around to greet him, a gentle smile on the same face Mark had seen on wooden ornaments and pictures throughout his life. The eyes were heavy, but kind, and he felt His love wash over him. With a sigh, he surrendered to the light, letting go of the last remnants of thought or questions. Slowly, the only thing in his mind was silence, his heart purged of desires both good and bad. His empty eye sockets turned toward the light at the centre of the marble city, his words the tortured chants of praise and worship.</p>
