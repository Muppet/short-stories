    <p>The Silence and the Lamb.

        “I… I think there’s been some kind of mistake” Mark said finally. He’d been standing in front of the podium waiting for some kind of explanation to all of this, but the… The Clerk, for lack of a better word, had simply crossed off his name in the great big book, as though that had been answer enough. He shuffled his feet nervously as he waited for the Clerk to notice him. 
        “Mʜʜ?” it said eventually in a voice that was more felt than heard. “Wᴀs ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ ᴀɴʏᴛʜɪɴɢ ᴇʟsᴇ?”
        “Well… I mean. This is all wrong” Mark protested again. “I’m in the wrong place. I have to be. You’ve made some kind of mistake!”
        “I sʜᴏᴜʟᴅɴ’ᴛ ᴛʜɪɴᴋ sᴏ… Yᴏᴜ ᴀʀᴇ Mᴀʀᴋ Aᴘᴘʟᴇʙʏ, ʏᴇs?”
        “Well… Yes”
        “Oғ  147 Oʀᴄʜɪᴅ Dʀɪᴠᴇ?”
        “... Yes”
        “Wᴇʟʟ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴀʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇɴ. Wᴇʟᴄᴏᴍᴇ ᴛᴏ Hᴇᴀᴠᴇɴ. Iғ ʏᴏᴜ’ʟʟ ʙᴇ ᴀs ᴋɪɴᴅ ᴀs ᴛᴏ ᴄᴀʀʀʏ ᴏɴ ᴛʜʀᴏᴜɢʜ ᴛʜᴇ ɢᴀᴛᴇs, ᴡᴏʀsʜɪᴘ sᴛᴀʀᴛs ᴏɴᴄᴇ ʏᴏᴜ’ᴠᴇ ғᴏᴜɴᴅ ʏᴏᴜʀ ʀᴏᴏᴍ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴀʟʟᴏᴡᴇᴅ ᴍᴀɴsɪᴏɴ” the Clerk gestured to a giant structure made of purest black pearl, polished so bright it almost shone, but it was a pale and bitter light and it looked all wrong. Pearls were supposed to be white as far as Mark was concerned. Maybe a cloudy pink grey, but definitely not polished black...
        
        He stood for a moment, staring at the brimstone podium looming before him. It was hard to determine what exactly the Clerk was, because it kept changing shape, but the impression that was left on his mind were words like “big” and “red” and most upsettingly, “on fire”. Mark was particularly struggling with this last notion as he knew beyond a doubt that angels weren’t supposed to be on fire. Talking bushes in the desert, possibly. But not the angels themselves. 
        
        And then there were the horns. They were protruding from what he assumed was its head, though the shape itself kept changing depending on the angle he observed it from. Just as worryingly, Mark was sure the red vine wrapped lazily around the base of the podium, flicking from side to side, was in fact its tail.
        
        “This can’t be heaven. It can’t be… Besides, you’re a demon!” He eventually managed, regretting it almost instantly. Mark froze, as he realised his words seemed to have upset the Clerk, or at the very least gotten its attention. He wasn’t quite sure if this wasn’t somehow worse. It was regarding him with more eyes than had any right to exist in any one head.
        “I ʙᴇɢ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴘᴀʀᴅᴏɴ?”
        “A demon! You must be! You’re on fire for Christ’s sake!”. Another hesitation at his last remark. It wasn’t like him to take the Lord’s name in vain, but he really was very upset, so before his brain could stop it, his mouth continued.
        “And this!” He gestured to a burning river that ran behind the Clerk, flowing to a great tree that appeared to be equally on fire, with 12 kinds of pulsating, black, bulbous fruits. “What do you call this?! Heaven has the tree of life, not… Whatever that is!”
        
        The Clerk sighed deeply, like a parent who’d just realised they were going to have to explain how food can enter one place, but something else comes out another. “Aʜ… Oɴᴇ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ ɪɴᴏ̨ᴜɪsɪᴛɪᴠᴇ ᴏɴᴇs, I sᴇᴇ”
        “Excuse me?”
        “Vᴇʀʏ ᴡᴇʟʟ ᴛʜᴇɴ, ʟᴇᴛ’s sᴛᴀʀᴛ ᴏᴜᴛ sʟᴏᴡ. Is ɪᴛ ɴᴏᴛ ᴡʀɪᴛᴛᴇɴ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ʙᴏᴏᴋ ᴏғ Rᴇᴠᴇʟᴀᴛɪᴏɴs 22:1-5 ᴛʜᴀᴛ ‘ᴛʜᴇ ᴀɴɢᴇʟ sʜᴏᴡᴇᴅ ᴍᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ʀɪᴠᴇʀ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀᴛᴇʀ ᴏғ ʟɪғᴇ, ʙʀɪɢʜᴛ ᴀs ᴄʀʏsᴛᴀʟ’?”
        “Yes! Exactly!”
        “Wᴇʟʟ… Cᴀɴ ɪᴛ ɴᴏᴛ ʙᴇ sᴀɪᴅ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ғɪʀᴇ ɪsɴ’ᴛ ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴀ sᴏᴜʀᴄᴇ ᴏғ ᴅᴇsᴛʀᴜᴄᴛɪᴏɴ, ʙᴜᴛ ᴀʟsᴏ ᴄʀᴇᴀᴛɪᴏɴ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴄʀᴇᴀᴛɪᴏɴ ɪs ʟɪғᴇ… Aɴᴅ ɪs ɪᴛ ɴᴏᴛ ᴜɴᴅᴇɴɪᴀʙʟʏ ʙʀɪɢʜᴛ?”
        His eyes widened with disbelief. “What? But… It’s supposed to be clear water. Fire can’t flow!”
        “Sᴀʏs ᴡʜᴏ?” the Clerk asked bemused. “Bᴇsɪᴅᴇs, ɪᴛ ɢᴏᴇs ᴏɴ ᴛᴏ sᴀʏ ‘ᴀʟsᴏ, ᴏɴ ᴇɪᴛʜᴇʀ sɪᴅᴇ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ ʀɪᴠᴇʀ, ᴛʜᴇ ᴛʀᴇᴇ ᴏғ ʟɪғᴇ ᴡɪᴛʜ ɪᴛs ᴛᴡᴇʟᴠᴇ ᴋɪɴᴅs ᴏғ ғʀᴜɪᴛ’ ᴀɴᴅ ᴀs ʏᴏᴜ ᴄᴀɴ sᴇᴇ, ɪᴛ’s ᴄʟᴇᴀʀʟʏ ᴀʟʟ ʀɪɢʜᴛ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ”
        “But… But that fruit’s disgusting! It’s moving. And oily black. That can’t be the fruit of life!”
        “I ᴅᴏɴ’ᴛ sᴇᴇ ᴡʜʏ ɴᴏᴛ. Hᴀᴠᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴇᴠᴇʀ ʜᴀᴅ Dᴜʀɪᴀɴ ғʀᴜɪᴛ, Hᴏʀɴᴇᴅ Mᴇʟᴏɴ ᴏʀ Bᴀᴇʟ Fʀᴜɪᴛ? Tʜᴇʏ’ʀᴇ ʜᴀʀᴅʟʏ ᴀᴘᴘᴇᴛɪsɪɴɢ”
        “Well… What about you then?! Explain that!” Mark said, pointing an accusing finger at the Clerk. “You’re on fire! Angels aren’t supposed to be on fire!”
        “I ᴅᴏɴ’ᴛ sᴇᴇ ᴡʜʏ ʏᴏᴜ’ᴅ ᴛʜɪɴᴋ sᴏ.” The Clerk replied, sounding almost a little offended. “I ʙᴇʟɪᴇᴠᴇ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴡᴏʀᴅ ғᴏʀ ᴜs ɪs Sᴇʀᴀᴘʜɪᴍ, ʏᴇs?”
        “... Yes?”
        “Wᴇʟʟ, ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴍᴇʀᴇʟʏ ᴍᴇᴀɴs ‘ᴛᴏ ʙᴜʀɴ’ ɪɴ ᴏʟᴅ Hᴇʙʀᴇᴡ, ᴡʜɪᴄʜ ɪs ᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ʟᴏᴛ ɢᴏᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ғɪʀsᴛ ᴛʀᴀɴsʟᴀᴛɪᴏɴs ғʀᴏᴍ… I’ᴅ ᴀʀɢᴜᴇ ɪᴛ’s ʀɪɢʜᴛ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ, ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴀᴍᴇ”. The manner in which it delivered this line was as though it thought this good enough, and as to indicate that he was dismissed, the Clerk cast its gaze back to the big book.
        
        “This is all wrong,” Mark whimpered, his tenuous grasp on sanity slowly slipping. It was bad enough that he had died before his day off, now he was having to deal with what could only be described as “otherworldly bureaucracy”. Surely this was what hell was like.
        
        He was increasingly aware of the wails, moans and chants coming from all around him, rising above the burning city that lay behind the Clerk. Bʀɪɢʜᴛ ᴄɪᴛʏ, a terrible voice in his head corrected.
        “No these are the screams and wails of the damned!” Mark protested. I sʜᴏᴜʟᴅɴ’ᴛ ᴛʜɪɴᴋ sᴏ, the voice replied. For a moment Mark wondered who had said that. The Clerk wasn’t paying him any attention but there was no one else here. No matter, nothing sacred could ever make such wails, of that, he was certain.
        
        Just as his mind reached this conclusion, the Clerk let out a deep sigh and pinched what Mark assumed was the bridge of a nose, with what he hoped was a hand, before turning its full attention to him. “Tʜᴀᴛ’s ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴇᴛᴇʀɴᴀʟ ᴘʀᴀʏᴇʀ. Yᴏᴜ ɢᴇᴛ ᴜsᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ɪᴛ” The Clerk replied matter of factly “Lɪᴋᴇ I sᴀɪᴅ, ᴏɴᴄᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ғɪɴᴅ ʏᴏᴜʀ ʀᴏᴏᴍ, ʏᴏᴜ sᴜʀʀᴇɴᴅᴇʀ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴡɪʟʟ ᴛᴏ Gᴏᴅ ᴀɴᴅ ᴛᴀᴋᴇ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴘʟᴀᴄᴇ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ɢʀᴇᴀᴛ ᴘʀᴀʏᴇʀ ᴡᴏʀsʜɪ-”
        “I’m sorry, I what?”
        “Tᴀᴋᴇ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴘʟᴀᴄᴇ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ɢʀᴇᴀ-”
        “No before that… I surrender my will?! I never agreed to that!”
        “I’ᴍ ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ sᴜʀᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴅɪᴅ” said the Clerk and managed to convey a frown in its voice that would have been impossible to detect in its ever changing face. “Iᴛ’s ᴄʟᴇᴀʀʟʏ sᴛᴀᴛᴇᴅ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ᴍᴀᴛᴇʀɪᴀʟ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴇʀᴇ ɢɪᴠᴇɴ”.
        “What!? What material?” Mark was becoming increasingly stressed about this whole ordeal. Someone was going to have to answer for this, of that he was sure.
        “Tʜᴇ ʙᴏᴏᴋ ʏᴏᴜ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ ᴀʟᴡᴀʏs ɢᴏ ᴏɴ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ. Iᴛ’s ᴀʟʟ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ. Iᴛ ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ᴄᴀɴ’ᴛ ʙᴇ ᴍʏ ғᴀᴜʟᴛ ɪғ ʏᴏᴜ ᴅɪᴅɴ’ᴛ ʙᴏᴛʜᴇʀ ʀᴇᴀᴅɪɴɢ ᴛʜᴇ ᴍᴀᴛᴇʀɪᴀʟ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴇʀᴇ ɢɪᴠᴇɴ”.
        “Book? What book? What in God’s name are you talking about?”
        “Tʜᴇ Bɪʙʟᴇ ᴏғ ᴄᴏᴜʀsᴇ… Aɴᴅ ᴡᴇ ᴜsᴜᴀʟʟʏ ᴅᴏɴ’ᴛ sᴀʏ Hɪs ɴᴀᴍᴇ ᴏᴜᴛsɪᴅᴇ ᴘʀᴀʏᴇʀ. Iᴛ’s ᴄᴏɴsɪᴅᴇʀᴇᴅ ɪᴍᴘᴏʟɪᴛᴇ”.
        “...” Mark’s mouth stood ajar. “Now I know you’re a demon!” he exclaimed triumphantly “Where in the Bible does it say I am to surrender my free will?!”
        
        
        The Clerk flicked a few pages in its great big tome, and Mark thought he could see the letters rearrange themselves on the pages that turned before him. Then it read out.
        “‘Aᴛ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴛɪᴍᴇ Jᴇʀᴜsᴀʟᴇᴍ sʜᴀʟʟ ʙᴇ ᴄᴀʟʟᴇᴅ Tʜᴇ Tʜʀᴏɴᴇ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ Lᴏʀᴅ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴀʟʟ ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴀᴛɪᴏɴs sʜᴀʟʟ ʙᴇ ɢᴀᴛʜᴇʀᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ɪᴛ, ᴛᴏ ᴛʜᴇ ɴᴀᴍᴇ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ Lᴏʀᴅ, ᴛᴏ Jᴇʀᴜsᴀʟᴇᴍ.

        Mark looked upon the Clerk with disbelief. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing, but if the Clerk noticed or cared, it gave no indication. Instead it continued.
        “‘Tʜᴇʀᴇғᴏʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴀʀᴇ ʙᴇғᴏʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛʜʀᴏɴᴇ ᴏғ Gᴏᴅ, ᴀɴᴅ sᴇʀᴠᴇ Hɪᴍ ᴅᴀʏ ᴀɴᴅ ɴɪɢʜᴛ ɪɴ Hɪs ᴛᴇᴍᴘʟᴇ. Tʜᴇʏ sʜᴀʟʟ ɴᴇɪᴛʜᴇʀ ʜᴜɴɢᴇʀ ᴀɴʏᴍᴏʀᴇ ɴᴏʀ ᴛʜɪʀsᴛ ᴀɴʏᴍᴏʀᴇ; ᴛʜᴇ sᴜɴ sʜᴀʟʟ ɴᴏᴛ sᴛʀɪᴋᴇ ᴛʜᴇᴍ, ɴᴏʀ ᴀɴʏ ʜᴇᴀᴛ.

        Mark interrupted before it could carry on, having just realised another thing that was bothering him about all of this. “I was actually wondering about that… Where is the sun?”
        “Aʜ” the Clerk said, taken aback slightly. “I ʙᴇʟɪᴇᴠᴇ Rᴇᴠᴇʟᴀᴛɪᴏɴ 21:23-25 ʜᴀs sᴏᴍᴇᴛʜɪɴɢ ᴛᴏ sᴀʏ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴛᴏᴏ. ‘Tʜᴇ ᴄɪᴛʏ ʜᴀᴅ ɴᴏ ɴᴇᴇᴅ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ sᴜɴ ᴏʀ ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ ᴍᴏᴏɴ ᴛᴏ sʜɪɴᴇ ɪɴ ɪᴛ, ғᴏʀ ᴛʜᴇ ɢʟᴏʀʏ ᴏғ Gᴏᴅ ɪʟʟᴜᴍɪɴᴀᴛᴇᴅ ɪᴛ.

Yᴏᴜ ᴄᴀɴ sᴇᴇ ᴛʜᴇ Lᴀᴍʙ ᴏᴠᴇʀ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ, ᴛᴇɴᴅɪɴɢ ᴛᴏ Hɪs ғʟᴏᴄᴋ” it said, and gestured toward a lone figure, half man, half goat, brown curly hair down to his shoulders. He was dressed in a white robe, walking amongst the rows of eternal worshippers, as a shepherd would his flock. Mark noticed his hands had gaping holes in them.
        
        “Aɴʏᴡᴀʏ, I ᴀᴄᴛᴜᴀʟʟʏ ᴛʜɪɴᴋ ᴏɴᴇ ᴏғ ʏᴏᴜʀ sᴏɴɢs ɢᴏᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴘᴏɪɴᴛ ᴀᴄʀᴏss ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴡᴇʟʟ. “Aᴍᴀᴢɪɴɢ Gʀᴀᴄᴇ”, I ʙᴇʟɪᴇᴠᴇ. ‘Wʜᴇɴ ᴡᴇ’ᴠᴇ ʙᴇᴇɴ ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ ᴛᴇɴ ᴛʜᴏᴜsᴀɴᴅ ʏᴇᴀʀs, ʙʀɪɢʜᴛ sʜɪɴɪɴɢ ᴀs ᴛʜᴇ sᴜɴ, ᴡᴇ’ᴠᴇ ɴᴏ ʟᴇss ᴅᴀʏs ᴛᴏ sɪɴɢ Gᴏᴅ’s ᴘʀᴀɪsᴇ ᴛʜᴀɴ ᴡʜᴇɴ ᴡᴇ’ᴅ ғɪʀsᴛ ʙᴇɢᴜɴ’”.
        Mark swallowed dryly… “But, that’s just a metaphor”.
        “Is ɪᴛ?” The Clerk gazed at him quizzically. Or as quizzically as an ever shifting number of eyes could.
        
        Looking back toward the Lamb, Mark had the sinking realisation that this was indeed his “saviour”. Although the goat legs made him think of someone else. Was this really why he was referred to as the Lamb? He also noticed that the source of light in this place came not from the sky, but from the fiery beings, the burning lake, and a great light at the centre of the black marble city. There, he beheld what he realised must surely be the burning light of God. It singed his eyes to stare at it, but he found himself unable to look away, all too late realising that his eyes had been burned from his sockets under its intensity, yet curiously, he felt no pain. In his mind, he finished the passage from Revelation 21:4 “He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.”
        
        The Clerk seemed to perk up as he thought this. “Sᴇᴇ, ɴᴏᴡ ʏᴏᴜ ɢᴇᴛ ɪᴛ. Iᴛ ᴊᴜsᴛ ɢᴏᴇs ᴏɴ ᴀɴᴅ ᴏɴ ғᴏʀᴇᴠᴇʀ. Jᴜsᴛ ʟɪᴋᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ ᴛᴇʟʟ ʏᴏᴜʀsᴇʟғ ᴅᴜʀɪɴɢ ʟɪғᴇ.

It felt almost deafening. Normal silence was merely the absence of sound but this felt like its opposite. An all consuming nothingness that demanded his attention in the same way that a roaring explosion would. The only thing convincing him that sound itself still existed were the wails and autonomous chants of worship, which in turn replaced the normal, and became a form of silence in themselves.
        “Nᴏ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴅɪsᴛʀᴀᴄᴛɪᴏɴs, ɴᴏ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ғᴇᴀʀ ᴏʀ sᴇʟғɪsʜ ᴛʜᴏᴜɢʜᴛs ɢᴇᴛᴛɪɴɢ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀʏ. Jᴜsᴛ ɴᴇᴠᴇʀ-ᴇɴᴅɪɴɢ ʟᴏᴠᴇ ғʀᴏᴍ ᴛʜᴇ ʟɪɢʜᴛ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴄᴏᴍᴘʟᴇᴛᴇ ᴘᴇᴀᴄᴇ, ᴡɪᴛʜᴏᴜᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛᴜʀᴍᴏɪʟ ᴛʜᴀᴛ sᴛᴇᴍs ғʀᴏᴍ ᴇᴍᴏᴛɪᴏɴ ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʜᴏᴜɢʜᴛ! Eᴠᴇʀʏᴛʜɪɴɢ ʏᴏᴜ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ ᴡᴇʀᴇ ᴘʀᴏᴍɪsᴇᴅ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴡᴀɴᴛᴇᴅ”
        Mark wasn’t sure, but he thought it was smiling. That just made it all the more terrible to behold. Then it dawned on him that, despite knowing his eyes were gone, the being in front of him was imprinted in his mind, clear as ever. He paused as he turned his head, and saw the otherworldly light of the… Angels, he supposed, and the burning rivers and trees, pierce the darkness of his blindness. The silhouette of the black pearl city was somehow a darker shade of black in his mind, looming in the background. All around, he could make out the shape of the city and its fiery inhabitants, but the worshippers were but shadows now, flickering wisps of darkness amongst the golden flames. 
        
        His heart sank, as he realised the awful truth of his situation: He truly was dead, and whatever afterlife he’d been promised in life, they’d gotten a few crucial details very wrong. “Can I…” he began.
        “Yᴇs?” The Clerk replied, not unkindly.
        
        “Can I ask what happens to the others?” Mark finally managed. “To the sinners?”.
        “Aʜ, ʏᴏᴜ ᴍᴇᴀɴ ᴛʜᴏsᴇ ᴡʜᴏ ʟɪᴠᴇᴅ ʟɪᴠᴇs ʀᴜʟᴇᴅ ʙʏ ᴏ̨ᴜᴇsᴛɪᴏɴs ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡʜɪᴍs ᴏғ ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴇᴀʀᴛ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴅᴇsɪʀᴇ?”
        Mark swallowed when he heard it phrased like that. “Yes? You said everyone comes here?”.
        “Wᴇʟʟ ɴᴏ ᴏʙᴠɪᴏᴜsʟʏ ɴᴏᴛ. Oɴʟʏ Hɪs ғʟᴏᴄᴋ ᴄᴏᴍᴇs ʜᴇʀᴇ. Mᴏsᴛ ᴅᴏɴ’ᴛ ɢᴏ ᴀɴʏᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ᴀᴛ ᴀʟʟ, ʙᴜᴛ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏᴏɴᴇ ɢᴏᴇs ᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴍᴇᴀɴ ᴛᴏ.

        “Lights? You mean it keeps the universe running?” Mark said, with uncertain hope. Some semblance of a promise that it was at least not all for naught, if it fueled all of creation itself.
        “Hᴍʜ? Oʜ ʜᴇᴀᴠᴇɴs ɴᴏ. Jᴜsᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ʟɪɢʜᴛs. Iᴛ ᴛᴀᴋᴇs ᴀ ʟᴏᴛ ᴛᴏ ғᴜᴇʟ ᴀʟʟ ᴛʜɪs ғɪʀᴇ, ʙᴜᴛ ᴡᴇ ғᴏᴜɴᴅ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴘʀᴀʏᴇʀ ʙᴜʀɴs ʙʀɪɢʜᴛᴇʀ ᴛʜᴀɴ ᴀɴʏ ᴏᴛʜᴇʀ sᴜʙsᴛᴀɴᴄᴇ. Nᴏ ᴛʜᴇ ᴜɴɪᴠᴇʀsᴇ ᴊᴜsᴛ ɢᴇᴛs ᴏɴ ᴡɪᴛʜ ɪᴛs ᴏᴡɴ ᴛʜɪɴɢ. Iᴛ ᴅᴏᴇsɴ’ᴛ ʀᴇᴀʟʟʏ ᴄᴀʀᴇ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜ ɢᴇᴛ ᴜᴘ ᴛᴏ” 
        
        If the Clerk noticed Mark wince at the notion that nothing he’d ever done mattered, it made no show of it. “Aɴʏᴡᴀʏ, ᴀs ᴍᴜᴄʜ ᴀs I’ᴅ ʟᴏᴠᴇ ᴛᴏ sɪᴛ ᴀɴᴅ ᴛᴀʟᴋ, ᴛʜᴇʀᴇ’s ᴀ ʙɪᴛ ᴏғ ᴀ ʟɪɴᴇ ʙᴜɪʟᴅɪɴɢ ʙᴇʜɪɴᴅ ʏᴏᴜ.

Wᴏʀᴋ ɴᴇᴠᴇʀ ᴇɴᴅs ᴇʜ?” The Clerk remarked jovially, as it returned to its great book.
        
        “Nᴇxᴛ ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ! Wᴇʟᴄᴏᴍᴇ ᴍᴏʀᴛᴀʟ, ɪғ ʏᴏᴜ’ʟʟ ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ sᴛᴀᴛᴇ ʏᴏᴜʀ ɴᴀᴍᴇ?” It said to someone behind him, and Mark felt a strange compulsion to advance through the black marble gates. He heard a voice exclaim “But this can’t be right! I’m in the wrong place!” but he didn’t bother turning around to see who else was about to realise that dying wasn’t the worst thing to happen to them today.
        
        Mark stepped forward, feeling his ability to resist fading with each step. Before him, the Lamb turned around to greet him, a gentle smile on the same face Mark had seen on wooden ornaments and pictures throughout his life. The eyes were heavy, but kind, and he felt His love wash over him. With a sigh, he surrendered to the light, letting go of the last remnants of thought or questions. Slowly, the only thing in his mind was silence, his heart purged of desires both good and bad. His empty eye sockets turned toward the light at the centre of the marble city, his words the tortured chants of praise and worship.
