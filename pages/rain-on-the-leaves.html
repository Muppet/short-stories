    <p>“You mother f-” Cole managed, as he slumped heavily against the tree behind him. The rain was falling heavily across the city, and visibility was low, but he could make out the silhouette of his killer, as he scurried off into the dark. He clutched his side, the blade still lodged deep, as his knees gave in and he slumped to the ground, a wet thud on the ground the final exclamation of his surrender.

        The three of them had wandered into the old cemetery that night, looking for the money Tom had buried. It had taken a while to figure out where the old bastard had hidden the stash, but to their luck, he’d found Christ in his last moments, before he was to be hung, and had confessed to the priest. Cole hadn’t enjoyed beating that information out of him, but it was better than leaving it to Meyers. The lad was dependable in a fight, which is why Norman kept him around, but he was unhinged at the best of times, and there was something about the way he smiled when he hurt people, that make Cole think he’d kill the holy man, before he got a chance to tell them where the money was. Once he’d gotten the information though, he’d let Meyers finish the job before Norman had told Cole to dump the corpse in the river. It wasn’t good to leave clues like that, but after the score tonight, Cole would have all the money he’d ever need and he had no plans of sticking around.
        
        “Should have seen it coming” he murmured to himself through lips caked in mud and blood. He wasn’t really angry at Norman for stabbing him, just annoyed that he’d done it first. He knew they were going to arrange for Meyers to have an accident in the cemetery, so there was less loot to split, and Cole had every intention of shooting Norman once they’d gathered all the money, before driving out of town. But he’d been caught off guard when the blade had sunk into his guts while he was still lifting the chest out of the grave. Even he hadn’t thought about taking Norman out, while there was still heavy lifting to be done. He looked down at where his hands were clutching his side, blood spilling onto the cobblestones, first slick with rain, then bathed in crimson as the moonlight gave a ghostly pal to the ebbing life essence, as it left his body. He smiled bitterly at his reflection. If it hadn’t hurt so damn much, it’d almost be funny. But not as funny as the look on Norman’s face, when he realised what he’d done. He almost wishes he could have been there to see his contingency plan spring into motion. Cole closed his eyes, the grim smile on his face his last salute to a world that wouldn't miss him.
        
        Norman grunted and glanced across the wet stones, where Meyers’ lifeless body lay, as he carefully carried the last chest toward the cart. The shovel strike to the back of the head, while he was still digging up the grave, hadn’t been gracious, nor fair, he mused. The splatter across the grave had stained the flowers there, but the rain on the petals and leaves was removing his handiwork before his eyes. Neither he nor Cole had much looked forward to taking him on in a real fight, so it had to be done. It had also had the desired effect on Cole. Realising the amount of work that they would have to do without Meyers’ help, had lulled him into a sense of security, thinking he had time before anyone had to act. Norman knew Cole would try something before they left the cemetery, so he’d decided to use this moment of peace to make his move. It had been easy sneaking up on him, the heavy rain masking his steps and the moon's silhouette making it hard to stay alert to one's surroundings. Cole had always been too sure of his own cunning, a thing Norman had done well to cultivate. As long as he thought he was the con-man, he’d not stay vigilant around the others. It had proved to be his undoing.
        
        As he finished loading up the cart and covered the money with the bags of dirt, old flowers and gardening tools that masked their get-away as normal cemetery workers, he took the reins, and slowly set the horses on route. From here, he’d drive back to the tavern where they’d stayed these last days, pick up his bags, and leave town, fast.
        
        Norman arrived at the tavern. It was quiet, but he was in too much of a hurry to notice. As he walked toward the lodgings they’d paid for, he failed to see that no other lights were on in the surrounding houses, and that no talk or music stemmed from the tavern itself. He let himself in and shut the doors behind him, before he lit the gas lamp before turning around to look for his bag. His face went white and his heart sank into his stomach, when he saw the sight before him. There, on his bed, lay the priest, dead as they came. His throat slit, the knife lying on the desk by the door. In a flash of recollection, Norman realised Cole had brought his travel bag with them when he picked them up in the cart. He said he’d dumped the priest in the river, but it was suddenly clear to Norman that Cole never had any intention of coming back to the Tavern.
        
        He became aware of torchlights flashing through the windows, and the sounds of boots in the yard. The constabulary was yelling instructions to unknown men to secure all exits and stop all guests from leaving. The sound grew louder as house by house, he could hear them kicking in the door.
        
        “You mother f-” he managed, as the door behind him sprung open.
